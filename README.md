Chainer Chemistry is a deep learning framework (based on Chainer) with
applications in Biology and Chemistry. It supports various state-of-the-art
models (especially GCNN - Graph Convolutional Neural Network) for chemical property prediction.

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](http://chainer-chemistry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Also, a quick introduction to deep learning for molecules and Chainer Chemistry
is available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/KentaOono/deep-learning-for-molecules-introduction-to-chainer-chemistry-93288837).

## Dependencies

Chainer Chemistry depends on the following packages:

 - [`chainer`](https://docs.chainer.org/en/stable/index.html)
 - [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org)
 - [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 - [`tqdm`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm)
 - [`pymatgen`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymatgen)
 - [`h5py`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/h5py)

These are automatically added to the system when installing the library via the
`pip` command (see _Installation_). However, the following  needs to be
installed manually:

 - [`rdkit (release 2019.03.2.0)`](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit)

Please refer to the RDKit [documentation](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
for more information regarding the installation steps.

Note that only the following versions of Chainer Chemistry's dependencies are
currently supported:

| Chainer Chemistry   | Chainer         | RDKit          | Python           |
| ------------------: | --------------: | -------------: | ---------------: |
| v0.1.0 ~ v0.3.0     | v2.0 ~ v3.0     | 2017.09.3.0    | 2.7, 3.5, 3.6    |
| v0.4.0              | v3.0 ~ v4.0 *1  | 2017.09.3.0    | 2.7, 3.5, 3.6    |
| v0.5.0              | v3.0 ~ v5.0 *2  | 2017.09.3.0    | 2.7, 3.5, 3.6    |
| v0.6.0              | v6.0 ~      *3  | 2017.09.3.0    | 2.7, 3.5, 3.6    |
| master branch       | v6.0 ~      *3  | 2019.03.2.0    | 3.6, 3.7         |
| v0.7.0 release plan | v7.0 ~          | 2019.03.2.0    | 3.6, 3.7      *4 |


[Footnote]

*1: We used `FunctionNode` in [this PR](https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-chemistry/pull/190),
which is introduced after chainer v3. See [this issue](https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-chemistry/issues/192) for details.

*2: Saliency modules only work after chainer v5.

*3: Chainer v6 is released and [ChainerX](https://chainer.org/announcement/2018/12/03/chainerx.html) is newly introduced.
    In order to support this new feature & API, we are going to break backward compatibility for chainer chemistry v0.6.0 release.
    See [ChainerX Documentation](https://chainer.org/announcement/2018/12/03/chainerx.html) for details.

*4: We are going to drop python 2.x support in the near future.
