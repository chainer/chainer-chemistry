Chainer Chemistry: Chainer extension library for Biology and Chemistry
======================================================================

`Chainer Chemistry <https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainer-chemistry>`_ is a collection of tools to train and run neural networks for tasks in biology and chemistry using `Chainer <https://chainer.org>`_ .

Features
--------

* State-of-the-art deep learning neural network models (especially graph convolutions) for chemical molecules (NFP, GGNN, Weave, SchNet etc.)
* Preprocessors of molecules tailored for these models
* Parsers for several standard file formats (CSV, SDF etc.)
* Loaders for several well-known datasets (QM9, Tox21 etc.)


Introductory to deep learning for molecules and Chainer Chemistry is also available `here (SlideShare) <https://www.slideshare.net/KentaOono/deep-learning-for-molecules-introduction-to-chainer-chemistry-93288837>`_.
