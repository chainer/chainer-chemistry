Chainer extension library for Biology and Chemistry
===================================================

`This library <https://github.com/pfnet-research/chainerchem>`_ is a collection of tools to train and run neural networks for tasks in biology and chemistry using `Chainer <https://chainer.org>`_ .

Features
--------

* State-of-the-art deep learning neural network models (especially graph convolutions) for chemical molecules (NFP, GGNN, Weave, SchNet etc.)
* Preprocessors of molecules tailored for these models
* Parsers for several standard file formats (CSV, SDF etc.)
* Loaders for several well-known datasets (QM9, Tox21 etc.)
